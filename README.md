# kivy-androidWatch
**Android** app that implements very basic touch screen-based character recognition. The core of the recognition system is implemented by a **SVM**. Similar to an Apple Watch, but this one is developed for Android, written in **Python**. Usually I develop Android apps in C++ but wanted to test the **Python-to-Android** toolchain offered by [**Buildozer**](https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The Image Processing and Machine Learning algorithms are implemented using **OpenCV** and the GUI using **Kivy**.


Here's a video of the app in action running on a Motorola mobile phone:
